    <h1>Software Projects</h1>
    <p>Here are some software projects I've worked on.</p>

    <h2>Motion Control Fighting Game - Solar Fairies</h2>
    <p>
        A project that I worked on is a motion controlled 1v1 fighting game. To
        play, you have to strike certain poses with your body to make your fairy
        character attack, defend, and evade. For this project, we used the Azure
        Kinect DK camera to do body tracking. I was responsible for all of the
        programming, and I also did the sound design for this game. The game is
        only available at Chihlee University of Technology in New Taipei City,
        Taiwan as an
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1738743353302591">interactive installation</a>
        in one of the buildings.

    <h2>Post-Stroke Rehabilitation Program - Hand Tracking Minigames</h2>
    <p>
        Another project I've had the pleasure of working on involved the
        development of minigames for post-stroke patients. The games are simple,
        in which the patient has to act out certain tasks using hand motions that
        benefit their post-stroke rehabilitation. E.g. wrist & elbow rotations.
        The movement of their hands is tracked using specialized cameras, and
        recorded for later analyzing and comparison.

    <h2>Spray Paint Interactive Installation</h2>
    <p>
        I've also programmed a spray paint system in Unity where you can do
        digital graffiti using virtual paint cans. The system was used in December
        2021 for
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/CHTdoctor/videos/655816722498352/">an interactive
            exhibition</a>
        at Kaohsiung, Taiwan. In developing the texture painting system, I learned
        a lot about shader programming and how game graphics worked.
