    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>Here are some projects I've worked on.</p>

    <h2>Motion Control Fighting Game - Solar Fairies</h2>
    <p>
        A project that I worked on is a motion controlled 1v1 fighting game. To
        play, you have to strike certain poses with your body to make your fairy
        character attack, defend, and evade. For this project, we used the Azure
        Kinect DK camera to do body tracking. I also did the sound design for this
        game.

    <h2>Post-Stroke Rehabilitation Program - Hand Tracking Minigames</h2>
    <p>
        Another project I've had the pleasure of working on had us developing
        minigames for post-stroke patients. The games are simple, in which the
        patient has to act out certain tasks using hand motions that benefit their
        post-stroke rehabilitation e.g. wrist & elbow rotations. The movement of
        their hands is tracked using specialized cameras, and recorded for later
        analyzing and comparison.

    <h2>Spraypaint Interactive Installation</h2>
    <p>
        I've also programmed a spray paint system where you can do digital
        graffiti. The system was used in 2021 for Kaohsiung City's Christmas
        Exhibition.
