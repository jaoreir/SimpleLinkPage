        <p>
            In university, I studied
            <a target="_blank" href="https://sccd.usc.edu.tw/">communications design</a>. After graduation, I worked as
            a game developer & programmer with a
            focus on body tracking, motion controls and XR using the Unity engine
            and C#.
            <a href="projects.html">You can see some of my software projects here</a>.
            Currently I am preparing for further studies overseas.

            <p>
                If you like weird electrionic music, then you can check out some music
                I made on
                <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/jaoreir">Soundcloud</a>
                and
                <a target="_blank" href="https://jaoreirmusic.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>. My main inspirations are
                <a target="_blank" href="https://c418.org/">C418</a>, VAPERROR, A.G.
                Cook, and METAROOM. Nowadays I don't write as much music as I used to,
                but I still play around with DAWs every now and then.

            <summary>Linux</summary>
            <p>
                Since May 2024 I've been daily driving a linux desktop PC. At first I
                was on NixOS to benefit from its declarative configuration. From doing
                so I learned a lot about how linux works and functional programming. I
                also had a lot of fun customizing a hyprland desktop environment, but
                ultimately I was too bothered by the instability of a rolling release
                distribution and incompatibilities of a few programs I wanted to run,
                so I switched to kubuntu and kept using almost all default settings.

            <summary>RUMBLE VR</summary>
            <p>
                I also play a VR fighting game called RUMBLE where you summon rocks to
                throw at each other.
