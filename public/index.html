            In university, I studied <a target="_blank" href="https://sccd.usc.edu.tw/">communications design</a>. After
            graduation, I worked as a game developer or programmer with a focus on body tracking, motion controls and XR
            using the Unity engine and C#. <a href="projects.html">You can read about some of my software projects
                here</a>. Currently I am preparing for further studies overseas.

            <summary>Linux</summary>
            <p>
                Since May 2024 I've been daily driving Linux on all of my computers. </p>
            <p>
                At
                first, I was on NixOS to benefit from its declarative configuration
                system. From doing so I learned a lot about how Linux works and some
                concepts from functional programming. I also had a lot of fun
                customizing a hyprland desktop environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                But ultimately I was too bothered by the instability of a rolling
                release distribution, the incompatibilities of a few programs I wanted
                to run, and the effort required to just make things work. </p>
            <p>
                So I decided
                to switch to Kubuntu in June 2025 and sticked to almost all default
                settings. I felt like this was a way more time-efficient approach to
                using Linux. Currently I'm pretty happy about it.

            <summary>Modded Minecraft</summary>
            <p>The video game I spend the most time playing is modded Minecraft. I currently have a singleplayer
                forever world started back in Oct 2024. My modlist is always changing, but the selection is always
                focused on compatibility, building, farming, and creating history inside the world. </p>
            <p>The main mods I use are:
            <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight">Farmer's Delight</a>, <a
                    target="_blank" href="https://modrinth.com/mod/lets-do-farm-charm">the Let's Do series</a>, and
                other farming mods
            </h3>
            <p>These mods provide a lot of new
                crops and meals to cook. A lot of the meals are also placeable in the world, which is great for
                interiors. </p>
            <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://modrinth.com/mod/via-romana">Via Romana</a></h3>
            <p>A mod that allows you to fast travel after creating paths between locations. It
                incentivises the building of transportation networks, which is in line with what I like to do. </p>
            <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://modrinth.com/mod/exposure">Exposure</a></h3>
            <p>This mod adds cameras and photos to the game, which makes recording the history of the
                world a lot more immersive and fun. I love taking pictures of random weird stuff I come across and
                pictures of newly constructed builds. </p>
            <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://modrinth.com/mod/touhou-little-maid">Touhou Little Maid</a></h3>
            <p>This mod provides lively NPCs based on characters from the Touhou Project
                that
                walk around and do work, making builds feel more alive. The maid stuff feels weird though. I don't
                want a companion in game. </p>
            <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://modrinth.com/mod/irons-spells-n-spellbooks">Iron's Spells and
                    Spellbooks</a></h3>
            <p>An easy magic mod for a casual player like me. The teleport spell
                is
                especially useful for building in survival. Another favourite spell of mine is the summon fireworks
                spell. It's really fun to explode everything in spectacular colour. </p>
            <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://modrinth.com/mod/create">Create</a></h3>
            <p>Create is used to generate resources for building, and to provide logistics networks for
                better inventory management. While other tech mods can do the same, create machines usually look
                better, so that's why it's my pick. </p>

            <summary>RUMBLE VR</summary>
            <p>I also play a 1v1 VR fighting game called <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/890550/RUMBLE/">RUMBLE</a> where you <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIR_2t9TskQ">summon rocks to throw at each other</a>. It has
                one of the most positive gaming communities I've ever seen. It's also a fun way to exercise :D </p>
            <p>However, I seem to be one of the only Asian players around. So I usually have to play cross region and
                suffer from very high latency. This pulled me away from getting good at the game, but pushed me to try
                out more unconventional playstyles to find my own fun. </p> <br />
